        "Method chaining is a technique in Python object-oriented programming (OOP) where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "# How it works:\n",
        "1. Each method returns the object itself (self).\n",
        "2. The returned object is used to call the next method.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Benefits:\n",
        "1. Improved readability: Method chaining makes the code more readable by reducing the number of lines and variables.\n",
